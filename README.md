# Likert Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. Decision tree learning employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by conducting a greedy search to identify the optimal split points within a tree. This process of splitting is then repeated in a top-down, recursive manner until all, or the majority of records have been classified under specific class labels.
